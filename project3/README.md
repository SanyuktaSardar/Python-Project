## 🔐 PyPassword Generator

### 📌 Project Description

The **PyPassword Generator** is a simple yet effective Python-based application designed to generate strong, randomized passwords based on user preferences. It allows users to customize the number of **letters**, **symbols**, and **numbers** they want in their password, ensuring better control and enhanced security.

### ✅ Features

* Interactive user input for customizing password content.
* Randomized selection of:

  * **Letters** (both uppercase and lowercase)
  * **Symbols** (e.g., `@`, `#`, `!`, etc.)
  * **Numbers** (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.)
* Password content is **shuffled** to improve security.
* Automatically saves each generated password to a local file named `Password.txt`.

### 🛠️ How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter:

   * Number of **letters**
   * Number of **symbols**
   * Number of **numbers**
2. The program randomly selects characters from predefined lists.
3. The generated characters are shuffled and combined into a final password.
4. The password is displayed and appended to a file called `Password.txt`.

### 💡 Example

```
Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!
How many letters would you like in your password? 5
How many symbol would you like? 2
How many numbers would you like? 3
Your password is: kA@7M)4q2
```

### 📝 File Structure

```

│
├── password_generator.py     # Main script file
├── Password.txt              # Output file where generated passwords are saved
└── README.md                 # Project documentation
```

### 📦 Requirements

* Python 3.x
* No external libraries needed (uses Python's built-in `random` module)

### 🔒 Note

Ensure your `Password.txt` file is stored securely and not shared publicly if it contains real passwords.
