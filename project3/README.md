# 🔐 PyPassword Generator & Strength Detector

## 📌 Project Overview

*The **PyPassword Generator** is a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** tool built in Python that allows users to:

#✅ Generate strong, custom passwords with letters, numbers, and symbols.
# 🔍 Detect password strength based on character types and length.
# 💾 Optionally save passwords** securely in a local text file.

This tool helps promote better password practices and reinforces programming fundamentals such as conditionals, loops, exception handling, and file operations.
